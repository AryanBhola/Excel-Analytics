## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze retail sales data to gain actionable insights that will enhance the performance of the coffee shop. 

## Analyzing Sales Data to Improve Performance

This project focuses on uncovering valuable insights from sales data to optimize the coffee shop's operations. Here are some key areas we'll be investigating:

#Sales Trends: We'll be examining how sales vary throughout the week and across different times of the day. This will help us identify peak sales periods and any potential slow periods that might require targeted promotions.
#Revenue by Month: We'll be analyzing total sales revenue on a monthly basis to track overall performance and identify any seasonal trends.
#Store Performance: We'll be comparing sales performance across different store locations to see if there are any variations. This will help us understand which locations are the most profitable and allow us to tailor strategies accordingly.
#Customer Insights: We'll be diving into customer purchase data to understand average order value and identify best-selling products (both by quantity and revenue). This will inform product placement decisions and promotional strategies.
# We will observe how the sales vary by product and category type.
